### Installation of payment link in order confirmation mail for backend orders
As of version 1.7.0 we have added a feature to include the payment link in the order confirmation mail for orders created in the backend.
This feature is customizable and can be changed to your liking.
This feature can be implemented by the following steps
1. Go to Marketing -> Email Templates
2. Add a template (import from "new order")
3. Add this *sample* code the template
    ````html
    {{depend order.getPayment().getAdditionalInformation('payment_link')}}
        <a href="{{var order.getPayment().getAdditionalInformation('payment_link')}}">Pay now with {{var order.getPayment().getAdditionalInformation('method_title')}}</a>
    {{/depend}}
    ````
4. Go to Stores -> Configuration -> Sales -> Sales Emails
5. Change the "New Order Confirmation Template" with your template

After these changes, the template should be tested to confirm it is working.

*Note*: This can also be implemented directly in the email template files.
